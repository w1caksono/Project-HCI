                Two trillion galaxies make up the current observable universe.
and yet, 94% of it are unreachable.

she must be lonely.. I mused, how could I not? humans are bound to the feeling of loneliness, we are forever tied to a curse of longing, unable to shake loneliness' grasp.

and yet, what about the ones who flicker in the night skies? they shine for us but.. who shines for them..?

photons travel at the speed of light and our naked eyes capture this signal and convert them into this sense of "sight".

the universe has nothing in similarity to us except the core particles that contrive of our beings. at least.. as far as our current understanding of it goes.

taking that into account, wouldn't it feel lonely if a star is not surrounded by satellites, dwarf planets, and other celestial bodies?

who shares their sentiment? for whom do they shed their heat and or masses to?

the imagination that we, as a human, become a type 3 civillisation seems far away, but for what and whom are we striving to do so?

if there exists a love story between man and alien, why can there not be a love story between man and universe?

it seems odd that a human would think of such a thing doesn't it? "love between man and universe" seems kind of silly, but does it really?

amongst the time that had passed in the forming of entire universe after the big bang, that singular spherical pocket expanded and formed a multitude of elements, stars, particles, quantum objects, and all sorts of space matter. that same universe, in its state, the parts of it with lesser density created what we currently understand as dark matter.

but what does dark matter do? it separates the denser parts of the universe away from each other. yes. what dark matter does is separate the universe from itself.

why? as an analogy, when humans feel lonely, we tend to separate ourselves from everyone around us, so doesn't that mean the superclusters that exist within the universe are similar to that of us humans? in a strictly poetic sense?

so then why? why is it that it does not shed tears? or.. maybe it does.. gamma ray bursts exist but can that be interpreted as the universe trying to reach out?

maybe the supermassive black hole in the centre of every galaxy is just the universe trying to conjoin things back together. for itself to feel as a whole...

thinking like that makes it hard for me to breathe... to be lonely but no one there...? it hurts...

a love story between a human, and the universe... it hurts.. tears swell and I clench my heart.. my heart beats loudly, piercing my eardrums... how can something so big be so lonely? something with so many things in it.. but nothing at the same time...?

I close my eyes and imagine kissing a representation of the universe, an imaginary form for something that cannot be "imagined" into a physical, touchable object.

holding out my arms to the sky, I tiptoe into a makeshift kiss for the stars.

a love story. between a human, and the universe.
